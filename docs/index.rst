People who like British TV shows, mystery dramas, and international series love Acorn TV.  It has a unique variety of material that you won't find on many other platforms, from riveting criminal thrillers to homey comedy set in the country.  You need to know how to use your Acorn TV account login safely and correctly to enjoy all of this entertainment.

 When you log in to your Acorn TV account, you can see your personal watchlist, saved series, account options, and subscription preferences.  Logging in smoothly helps make sure that streaming doesn't stop, no matter what device you're using to watch it.

 How do I log in to my Acorn TV account?

 To get started, go to the official Acorn TV website or use the Acorn TV app on your phone or tablet.  Find the option to sign in on the home screen.  Type in the email address and password you use to log in to your Acorn TV account.  If you enter the information correctly, you'll be taken to your dashboard. From there, you may pick up where you left off or look for new shows to watch.

 You might need to enter a code or activate your account on a different device by going to the Acorn TV activation page if you use a TV app like Roku, Amazon Fire TV, or Apple TV.  Follow the procedures on the screen, and after your device is authenticated, it will be linked to your Acorn TV account login.

 What if I forget my Acorn TV login information?

 It's normal to forget your login information, especially if you haven't used it in a while.  If you can't remember your password, go to the login page and click the "Forgot Password?" link.  Type in the email address you used to set up your account.  You will get an email from Acorn TV with instructions on how to change your password.

 Pick a strong password that you don't use for anything else and think about keeping it safe in a password manager.  If you don't get the email to reset your password, look in your spam or garbage bin.  Check to see that you're using the same email address you used to sign up for Acorn TV.

 Why can't I get into my Acorn TV account?

 There are a few frequent problems that could be keeping you from getting into your account.  First, check that you are entering the right login information.  If you make a mistake in your email address or password, you won't be able to log in.  Also, make sure your subscription is still active.  You might not be able to get in until you update your payment method if it has expired or failed.

 If your internet connection is slow or unpredictable, it can also make it hard to log in.  If it doesn't work, try restarting your device or switching networks.  If you're having trouble logging in using a TV app, removing and reinstalling the software can typically fix the problem.

 If none of these fixes work, you can get in touch with Acorn TV customer service through their website for help that is specific to you.

 How to Keep Your Acorn TV Account Safe

 Streaming services need to be just as safe as your bank or social media accounts.  You can update your billing information and see your specific viewing history with your Acorn TV account login, so it's important to keep your login information safe.

 Don't tell anyone your password, including friends or family, and always log out after you're done using a public or shared device.  Make sure your password is strong and different from any other passwords you use.  Always examine the source of any emails that ask for your login details.  Acorn TV will never ask you for personal information over email.

 Watching Acorn TV on More Than One Device
